# Hi there, I'm Ramon ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist, a bit of a researcher, and an educator. I grew up playing baseball in the Dominican Republic, and picked up coding while at uni after MS Excel and I had a dissagreement regarding the size of the data it would let me analyze, among others issues, of course. The rest, alongside an apology for any poorly-written code found here, is history.

A few things about me

- :mortar_board: I teach data science for a living, and I also try to do it often as I can atconferences.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on too many projects for my own good.
- :nerd_face: Iâ€™m currently learning how to automate the initial steps of a data science project, that is, how to go as quickly as possible from data to a POC.
- :books: Iâ€™m currently reading, Effective Data Science Infrastructure.
- :mountain_biking_man: Iâ€™m constantly mountain biking
