# Hi there, I'm Ramon ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist, a bit of a researcher, and an educator. I grew up playing baseball in the Dominican Republic, and picked up coding while at uni after MS Excel and I had a dissagreement regarding the size of the data it would let me analyze, among others issues, of course. The rest, alongside an apology for any poorly-written code found here, is history.

A few things about me

- :mortar_board: I teach data science and machine learning engineering for a living, but I also try to do it often as I can at different conferences.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on too many projects for my own good. These include a tech-ed non-profit organization in the Dominican Republic and a series of lessons on different ML Deployment strategies and architectures.
- :nerd_face: Iâ€™m currently learning how to automate the initial steps of a data science project via CI/CD pipelines to go as quickly as possible from data and models to a POC.
- :books: Iâ€™m currently reading, Effective Data Science Infrastructure.
- :mountain_biking_man: Iâ€™m constantly mountain biking.
