# Hi there, I'm Ramon ðŸ‘‹

I am a data scientist, a bit of a researcher, and an educator. I grew up playing baseball in the Dominican Republic, and picked up coding while at uni after MS Excel and I had a dissagreement regarding the size of the data it would let me analyze, among others issues, of course. The rest, alongside an apology for any poorly-written code found here, is history.

A few things about me

- :mortar_board: I love teaching data science at conferences, and have also done it for a living.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on three projects
  1. A kickstarter predictive application where you can input the details of your product/campaign and get a prediction on whether you'll receive your desire funding amount within your timeframe.
  2. An NLP and Geospatial analysis of Yelp and Airbnb data. Reviews can often influence our decisions of what and where to eat, where to stay, and even which events to attend to for a night out. With that in mind, I am searching for the connecting dots between a marketplace for stays and another for eats.
  3. An app where you can ask privacy-preserving questions about your favorite websites and apps to a chatbot built using the privacy policy section of thousands of "Free" websites/apps.
- :nerd_face: Iâ€™m currently learning, from an educational standpoint, how to reduce the time it takes to put machine learning models in production while using the least amount of tools as possible.
- :books: Iâ€™m currently reading, Engineering MLOps and Fastai.
- :mountain_biking_man: Iâ€™m constantly mountain biking
